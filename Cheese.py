#Implement some sort of loss stop
#Trend Following strategy. 

#Have some sort of data scraper to run at the beginning of the year and
#use certain values and ratios to determine what stocks to "focus" on, 
#Alongside how much a company has grown in a certain timeframe

#These could include the EBIT ratio, revenue growth rate, etc

#Use this to compute  a score that lets us determine Trend Following 
#allowance and flexibility. 

#Our Trend Follwoing algorithm looks for what stocks
#In our focus group are underperforming with looser allowances for stop 
#losses, as a company with a string k10 would likely bounce back

#Additionaly, the Trend Follwoing would see which stocks are rising
#rapidly to add them to our portfolio, but with way stricter stop loss
#parameters.
